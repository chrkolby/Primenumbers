# Primenumbers

Compile: javac Eratosthenes.java

Run sequential: java Eratosthenes x seq

Run parallell: java Eratosthenes x par

x = upper limit for the check, example: x = 1000 will find all primes from 0 to 1000.

Uses Eratosthenes technique for finding prime numbers and factorize the 5 largest and the 95th to 100th largest, runs either on one thread or multithreaded for increased performance.
